# Particle Rain — Ultra Performance

A high-performance particle rain simulation in HTML5 Canvas.  
Push your device to the limit with up to **2,000,000 particles** and ultra stress-testing features.  
Includes auto-throttle and smart sampling so the UI stays responsive even at very low FPS.

## Features

- **Max particles:** up to 2,000,000 (configurable)
- **Burst spawn:** up to 50,000 per click
- **Gravity, wind, size controls**
- **Auto-throttle:** adapts rendering for low FPS to avoid device crash
- **Stress mode:** spawn as many as your device can handle
- **Responsive UI:** control panel with real-time stats

## Usage

1. Open `particle-rain-ultra.html` in your browser.
2. Use the UI to configure particle count, burst size, gravity, wind, and particle size.
3. Start, stop, stress, or clear particles from the control panel.
4. Tap/click on the canvas to spawn bursts. Long press for continuous bursts.
5. Watch FPS and particle stats — auto-throttle keeps the app running even under extreme load.

## Warning

- **High particle counts can freeze or crash devices.**
- Use stress mode and high values at your own risk!
- Auto-throttle will try to recover, but extremely high settings may require a page reload.
